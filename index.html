    <h3><img src="https://cdn.betterttv.net/emote/566ca1a365dbbdab32ec055b/1x" alt="" height="28" width="84">  VOD Chat  <img src="https://cdn.betterttv.net/emote/566ca1a365dbbdab32ec055b/1x" alt="" height="28" width="84"></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Everything that you can do in Live stream view is possible in the VOD view, including Chat / Multiview modifications, Peekview, ect. But keep in mind that this view is mainly for VODs, so even tho you can open streams from the Peekview, don't be surprised that you won't see the live chat. In the future i will unify the VOD and Live stream experience.   </li>
        <li>In the VOD view can open the PeekView by LONG PRESSING the DPAD_UP</li>
        <li>Previously you were able to control the VOD player with Play/FF/RW buttons on your remote. This has been removed, since these buttons are reserved for the Remote Shortcuts, and there is no remote shortcut for this playback functionality. You have to use the UI video controls.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Chat:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The message that @mentions you will be highlighted.</li>
    </ul>
    

    <h3>Remote Shortcut</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>*NEW*: open Stream in an External Player. So you can open the stream in a pop-up player for example: Best Video Popup Player. You need to sideload it, but don't even try with without an airmouse or Shield's Remote App. The advantage of this over the framework supported PIP is that these apps are resizable and movable. None of these are possible with the Android TV framework's PIP. You need to enable a special permission to make this work.
            <b>Shield:</b> Settings -> Apps -> Special app access -> Display over other apps
        </li>
        <li>*NEW*: save the currently watched LIVE stream's position as a VOD Resume point, so you can continue watching the VOD from this, saved position.</li>
        <li>*NEW*: pause chat. Keep in mind that messages between paused and the resumed state will be lost.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>General:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Search: Channel results are ordered by they follower count in descending order</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Fix:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Updated BTTV emote api, which caused messages not showing / missing emotes.</li>
        <li>Settings didn't closed on a single BACK action</li>
        <li>Chat: 'Video + side by side' and 'Show chat' settings should work as expected. Which means that using 'Show Chat button' should put the view into side-by-side mode and vice versa.</li> 
    </ul>


    <hr>
    <h1>v1.3.1 (2019.12.22)</h1>

    <h3>Settings:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Stream: *NEW* Remote shortcuts: you can customize the Play, Fast Forward and Previous remote buttons</li>
        <li>Stream: Show the online viewer and streamer count (ON by default). It's the same thing just like on the Main screen</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Stream:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Changed the Control Buttons colors, it follows your currently active theme color</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Fix:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Long press refresh inside Categories works again (thx LAM09)</li>
        <li>Followed streams and categories were missing from Peekview when you resumed the app from the background in a certain case (thx kurtdh) </li>
    </ul>
    <hr>


    <h1>v1.3.0 (2019.12.17)</h1>
    <h3>PeekView 2.0</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>It has multiple rows now. Everything that you can access on the Main screen you can access in PV, except Channel profiles, Past Broadcasts and the Settings row</li>
        <li>The rows visibility obeys your settings in General -> 'Show/hide rows on Main screen' and 'Stream language row'. So if you hid something on the Main screen, that row won't show up in PV.</li>
        <li>By default the topmost row shows the same category that you are already watching. So if your currently viewed streamer plays Apex, this row will show every Apex streamer. </li>
        <li>If a row is empty (exp. non of your followed steamer are streaming currently), the row indicator temporarily turns red and the row is skipped.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Stream:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Video quality: the menu got revamped. Changing quality should be much easier now.</li>
        <li>Chat size and position buttons are merged into one. Remote shortcut: Rewind/Prev</li>
        <li>Multiview size and position button added. Remote shortcut: Forward/Next</li>
        <li>Both of these edit modes can be closed by the BACK, DPAD_CENTER buttons, or toggle it with the remote shortcut</li>
        <li>New icon for LIVE and RERUN on the Peekview card</li>
        <li>I've changed the Play/Pause shortcut: short press -> Video+Chat side-by-side mode, long press -> Chat show/hide</li>
        <li>Tooltips on Control buttons, you can turn this off in the Settings -> Stream</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Chat:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Added Partner, Prime, VIP and Broadcaster icons. You can hide the Prime icon in Settings -> Chat.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Settings:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chat: font size (this also scales emotes and chat window width)</li>
        <li>Chat: new window sizes from 50,100% to 25,33,50,66,75,100%</li>
        <li>Chat: new window positions</li>
        <li>Stream: Multiview position</li>
        <li>Stream: Multiview size</li>
        <li>Stream: Video + chat side by side scale mode: Fit to screen or Center crop</li>
        <li>Stream: *NEW* Clock settings. You see the current time and date during a stream, by turn on the control buttons. You can also turn on 3 customizable "World Clock". </li>
        <li>Stream: Show tooltips on control buttons (ON by default)</li>
        <li>"Tree icon" removed, and replaced with an audio swap button. If you have a Multiview open you can swap between the two video's audio. Either with this button or long pressing your DPAD Down button.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>General:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Main screen: remote shortcuts: Play/Pause button: Refresh, Rewind button: open Settings</li>
        <li>Changing a theme will automatically restarts the app. The app should restart in a couple of seconds with your selected theme.</li>
        <li>Exoplayer updated to 2.10.8</li>
        <li>Added Google Firebase Crashlytics, Analytics, Performance. These are for more detailed crash reports, app usage and performance numbers. With these information i can improve the app reliability and performance in the future.</li>
        <li>Project updated to AndroidX</li>
        <li>Lowered a couple of unnecessarily long UI animations</li>
        <li>Added a reminder to the Main screen when a new app version is released</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Fix:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Watching a stream then going back to the OS home screen, and then launching the app again with it's icon, should resume the stream, instead of landing on app's Main screen.</li>
        <li>Fixed a crash which occurred in the Settings</li>
        <li>Show the correct uptime in hours and minutes if the stream is up for more then 24h (thanks LAM09)</li>
        <li>Empty rows are removed on the Main screen, so if no followed stream is live, the row is hidden</li>
        <li>'Video + chat side by side by default' and 'Auto show chat on playback' works as expected. Keep in mind that side-by-side mode has 3 states: Normal, Fit to screen, Center crop. If 'Auto show chat on playback' is OFF, side-by-side's default state will be in Normal mode. So if you press 'Show Chat' in this state, nothing will happen. You have to enter side-by-side mode first (fit to scren / center crop), then 'Show chat' will behave as expected.</li>
        <li>Channel profile: Past broadcast row has the correct profile color</li>
        <li>NVIDIA Shield's menu or Sony Bravia's Action Menu won't pause the stream anymore.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Known issues:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Twitch changed they APIs and you are unable to follow/unfollow categories. There is a possible way to circumvent this, so i might be able to fix it in the future</li>
    </ul>

    <center><h4> Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!</h4></center>
    <hr>

    <h1>v1.2.5 (2019.11.14)</h1>
    <p>If you are using any other 3rd party Twitch apps you might noticed that, all the sudden they have a lot of issues. We don't really know the actual reason behind this. Maybe Twitch is changing the APIs or the servers are having performance issues. Some APIs are working correctly then a day later we can't access them anymore, few hours later it's fine again. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

    <p>Whatever is going on at Twitch, i'm hoping that it will be solved soon, and that "solution" won't affect us in any negative way. Twitch is using it's own APIs, meanwhile we - the plebs - are using APIs for 3rd party developers. This is why the official Twitch products are working correctly while our apps are failing.</p>

    <h3>VOD:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fast forward / rewind button steps: using the bottom video search bar you can skip through the VOD in 20 steps (5% per step). This is the default. But using the FF or Rewind buttons, from now on, you can move much slower in 200 steps (0,5% per step). In the future i will provide a proper -/+ 30sec or 1 minute buttons for more precision. So use the search bar for quick movement, and then use the buttons for fine steps.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Chat:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Show/hide with Play, Play/Pause buttons</li>
        <li>Change size with Rewind, Media Previous buttons</li>
        <li>Change position with Forward, Media Next buttons</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Fix:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chat: Previously rectangular emotes were incorrectly scaled, this is fixed. </li>
        <li>VOD: It's working again, but you can't access Sub-only VODs. That's the only way to fix it currently.</li>
        <li>Followed Games row loads again, for a while...</li>
    </ul>


    <hr>

    <h1>v1.2.4 (2019.08.04)</h1>
    <h3>Fix:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Multiview: swapping audio should work now</li>
        <li>MultiView: removed a "black out" animation during view swap, on a slower device you might see some graphical artifact during the swap.</li>
        <li>Fixed Notifications on Pie</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>MultiView:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>DPad_DOWN short press: swap between the views</li>
        <li>DPad_DOWN long press: swap the <b>audio</b> between the views</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>

    <h1>v1.2.3 (2019.07.31)</h1>
    <h3>Fix:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Video playback works with Pie now. Previously when you opened a stream, the stream was "offline".</li>
        <li>Fixed a lot of memory leaks. "Stats for Nerds" is the only thing that leaks memory, i'm waiting for the library's maintainer to fix it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>General:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Google Assistant: you can open the app with voice command, like 'open/start Sound TV'</li>
        <li>Stream should start in 1080p immediately, instead of 720p and switching up to 1080p right after it</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Stream:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Video size button <td><img src="video_size.png" alt="" height="40" width="40"></td> has 3 states now: Normal, Shrink the view and keep the aspect ratio and Crop Zoom. This will cut off the sides of the video, but keeps the video height full screen.</li> 
    </ul>

    <h3>Known issues:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In the Channel profiles, video cards has the default theme color, instead of using the profile's color</li>
        <li>Chat stops working for no reason. This affects the Shield and FireTV users, which is odd, because it works fine on Bravia or on the MiBox. I'm working on this.</li>
    </ul>

    This patch was in the works for a while now, and this quick Pie release for the Shield got me pants down, so i had to release. But this patch also has some sneak peek for the future. I don't do any "serious" development right now, i will start doing that ~mid-late September, but i included something in this build.

    <h3>Early preview:</h3>
    <h4>Multi view:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Opening the Peekview and long pressing on a card, the MultiView will open, with the selected stream.</li>
        <li>With Dpad Down, you can swap between the two opened streams.</li>
        <li>Bob Ross mode <td><img src="bob_ross.png" alt="" height="40" width="40"> is repurposed. With this you can swap the audio between the two stream. I will remove the Bob Ross mode in the future, because it's pointless now.</li>
        <li>When Multiview is active, opening anything in the Peekview will open it in the Multiview</li>
        <li>You can close the Multiview by long pressing on a card again, or pressing the Back button.</li>
        <li>Right now the Multiview is in Auto quality, and you can't change it.</li>
        <li>There is no Chat for the Multiview, but in the future there will be.</li>
        <li>There will be an audio only mode, so Multiview will be audio only, and you can watch something on the main, and listen to someone else.</li>
        <li>You might experience issues with this, because it's in early development. If your device is dropping a lot of frames (both streams are slow), this might due to it being underpowered. So i only expect this feature to work with 2017+ Bravias, Shield and with the Mibox. It didn't even worked with the FireTV.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h1>v1.2.2 (2019.04.14)</h1>
    <h3>Stream:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Finally i managed to fix the main reason why the app never performed as good as the original app in terms of data loading / buffering. This also means that the previous update's buffering settings are unnecessary. Although i won't remove the ability to change the these settings, if you need them for some reason. But meanwhile i resetted your settings if you did setup something custom. </li>
        <li>This fix should solve your (micro)buffering issues if you had any.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Settings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Miscellaneous: Turn on stats on stream start</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <hr>

    <h1>v1.2.1 (2019.04.08)</h1>
    <h3>Chat:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You can see the chat even if you're not logged in, but you can't send messages</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Stream:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Settings: 'Buffering settings' You can change the buffering settings if you have problem with playback. If that's the case, increase 'BUFFER_FOR_PLAYBACK_MS' and 'BUFFER_FOR_PLAYBACK_AFTER_REBUFFER_MS'. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Fix:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chat: missing subicons</li>
        <li>Game artworks: since some games change they artwork seasonally (exp.: Fortnite, Overwatch), the app didn't updated these artworks immediately, sometimes it took a week or more. From now on, the app redownloads them once every day.</li>
        <li>Vod playback: Auto quality should be more reliable, instead of constantly switching resolutions.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>On ads:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If you are in the US, you might noticed the ads pre-stream or mid stream. This is because Twitch is testing it's SureStream tech, which embeds ads INTO the video stream. From my brief research, i could do something about it, but i won't. The main reason is quite simple, i would brake Twitch TOS. Which i'm already doing, by getting the direct HLS stream, instead of using they Javascript player (which would be a ton of fun for dual core Bravia users <img src="https://cdn.frankerfacez.com/emoticon/278909/1">). So i would draw the line here.</li> 
        <li> If you want to avoid ads, i would suggest: </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Twitch Nitro ($8.99 / month): Ad-Free Viewing (with limited exceptions)</li>
            <li>Use a VPN service. You don't even have to target EU servers, maybe a server in the next state will be sufficient. I wont name the VPN provider, but from my testing i only got ads on they 'US East' server, meanwhile DC, NY, Florida, LA, etc were all "clean". Also with VPN apps, you can use per-app settings. So you don't have to force all your traffic through the VPN, you can set it only for my app.   </li>
        </ul>
     </ul>
    <br>
    <hr>

    <h1>v1.2 (2019.02.25)</h1>
    <h3>General:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed a bug that "silently" crashed the app. You should feel a significant smoothness in scrolling on a row or between rows, exp.: on the Main screen</li>
        <li>Moved most of the API loadings to Ion, this speeds up loading/reload times</li>
        <li>ExoPlayer (2.9.5)</li>
        <li>Setting: Auto refresh (explained in the Settings, ON by default and 20min)</li>
        <li>Setting: UI Themes (red, blue, purple, green, pink, orange, yellow, grey)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Chat:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Improved Chat startup time</li>
        <li>Significantly improved Emote loading times. This puts the app on par with the desktop experience. It's able to keep up even with xQc's "quality chat".</li>
        <li>Setting: Show/hide Gifted subs messages in the chat (ON by default)</li>
        <li>Improved readability of sub and gifted sub messages</li>
        <li>FFZ channel enabled emotes are activated</li>
        <li>Setting: Open soft keyboard when the send Chat message window is opened from the UI (ON by default). If you open the chat window with the keyboard shortcut (J or F) this will not affect you, even when the setting is ON.</li>
        <li>Setting: Filter out popular bots and they command from chat</li>
        <li>Setting: Filter 'chat bots' by name (OFF by default)</li>
        <li>Setting: Join Chat (ON by default)</li>
        <li>Setting: Chat delay (no delay by default)</li>
        <li>Updated the ASCII dick filter with new characters (yes, there is such thing)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notification: (NEW)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You get a notification when your followed streamer went live. This works even when the app is in the background.</li>
        <li>The check runs every minute.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Stream:</h3>
    <ul>
        <h4>PeekRow: (NEW)</h4>
            <li>With the DPAD_UP button on your remote, you can open a row of cards on the bottom of the screen while watching a stream. The row contains the Main screen's "Followed" row, so you can switch between your Followed online streams without going back to the Main screen.</li>
            <li>Few settings added under Stream -> PeekRow</li>


        <h4>General:</h4>
        <li>Hosting is now supported, so if your current streamer starts to host someone else, the app automatically redirects to the hosted streamer.</li>
        <li>Better playback error feedback, this is true for VOD as well.</li>
        <li>Stat for nerds button: if you turned on the feature, you can open it now from the UI.</li>
        <li>Settings: set default VOD video quality, Auto or Source (Default is Auto)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Fix:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Followed channels and games limit 25->100</li>
        <li>Follower count formatting</li>
        <li>If you are subbed to a channel, but you still can't access the sub-only VODs, a logout+login should fix that. In the near future i will fix this.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue that caused lower fps(<30fps) in the Stream Category while scrolling on Oreo</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue when opening a Channel profile, colors didn't loaded in a certain situation</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue when you couldn't see chat, because you had special characters in your name</li>
        <li>Fixed a unresponsive UI bug on Oreo. Previously, after a while, the Main screen did not reacted to 'Refresh' and when you tried to watch something the Stream/VOD didn't loaded.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Etc:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Removed Card caching setting, because it's not necessary anymore.</li>
        <li>Notification on the Main screen if you received a new app version. </li>
    </ul>
