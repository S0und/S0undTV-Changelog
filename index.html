    <h1>v1.2 (2019.02.25)</h1>
    <h3>General:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed a bug that "silently" crashed the app. You should feel a significant smoothness in scrolling on a row or between rows, exp.: on the Main screen</li>
        <li>Moved most of the API loadings to Ion, this speeds up loading/reload times</li>
        <li>ExoPlayer (2.9.5)</li>
        <li>Setting: Auto refresh (explained in the Settings, ON by default and 20min)</li>
        <li>Setting: UI Themes (red, blue, purple, green, pink, orange, yellow, grey)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Chat:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Improved Chat startup time</li>
        <li>Significantly improved Emote loading times. This puts the app on par with the desktop experience. It's able to keep up even with xQc's "quality chat".</li>
        <li>Setting: Show/hide Gifted subs messages in the chat (ON by default)</li>
        <li>Improved readability of sub and gifted sub messages</li>
        <li>FFZ channel enabled emotes are activated</li>
        <li>Setting: Open soft keyboard when the send Chat message window is opened from the UI (ON by default). If you open the chat window with the keyboard shortcut (J or F) this will not affect you, even when the setting is ON.</li>
        <li>Setting: Filter out popular bots and they command from chat</li>
        <li>Setting: Filter 'chat bots' by name (OFF by default)</li>
        <li>Setting: Join Chat (ON by default)</li>
        <li>Setting: Chat delay (no delay by default)</li>
        <li>Updated the ASCII dick filter with new characters (yes, there is such thing)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notification: (NEW)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You get a notification when your followed streamer went live. This works even when the app is in the background.</li>
        <li>The check runs every minute.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Stream:</h3>
    <ul>
        <h4>PeekRow: (NEW)</h4>
            <li>With the DPAD_UP button on your remote, you can open a row of cards on the bottom of the screen while watching a stream. The row contains the Main screen's "Followed" row, so you can switch between your Followed online streams without going back to the Main screen.</li>
            <li>Few settings added under Stream -> PeekRow</li>


        <h4>General:</h4>
        <li>Hosting is now supported, so if your current streamer starts to host someone else, the app automatically redirects to the hosted streamer.</li>
        <li>Better playback error feedback, this is true for VOD as well.</li>
        <li>Stat for nerds button: if you turned on the feature, you can open it now from the UI.</li>
        <li>Settings: set default VOD video quality, Auto or Source (Default is Auto)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Fix:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Followed channels and games limit 25->100</li>
        <li>Follower count formatting</li>
        <li>If you are subbed to a channel, but you still can't access the sub-only VODs, a logout+login should fix that. In the near future i will fix this.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue that caused lower fps(<30fps) in the Stream Category while scrolling on Oreo</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue when opening a Channel profile, colors didn't loaded in a certain situation</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue when you couldn't see chat, because you had special characters in your name</li>
        <li>Fixed a unresponsive UI bug on Oreo. Previously, after a while, the Main screen did not reacted to 'Refresh' and when you tried to watch something the Stream/VOD didn't loaded.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Etc:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Removed Card caching setting, because it's not necessary anymore.</li>
        <li>Notification on the Main screen if you received a new app version. </li>
    </ul>
